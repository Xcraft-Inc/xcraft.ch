### Contexts

Scope the desktop to a dedicated workcontext, each tasks and opened tabs will be
scoped in that context.

Ideally a goblin module can provide context, tasks and workitems and can be
integrated by composition in the existing app, as a new availble context.

### Tasks

Provide to user contextual tasks launcher.

### Tabs

Provide task switching by context.

### Workitems

Main container for working on something generaly opened in a tab. The goblin
workshop provide a variety of configurable goblins to add as workitem, for
searching or editing entities (CRUD).

### Dialogs

A modal dialog can be opened on top of the current workitem.

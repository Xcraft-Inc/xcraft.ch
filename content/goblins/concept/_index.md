# Concept

The goblin idea match perfectly with the actor model of Carl Hewitt designed
in 1973. We don't know this model before designing this framework, after some
search on wikipedia we discover that our work match the following definition
perfectly.

> The actor model in computer science is a mathematical model of concurrent
> computation that treats actor as the universal primitive of concurrent
> computation. In response to a message it receives, an actor can: make local
> decisions, create more actors, send more messages, and determine how to
> respond to the next message received. Actors may modify their own private
> state, but can only affect each other indirectly through messaging (removing
> the need for lock-based synchronization). -- Wikipedia [source][1]

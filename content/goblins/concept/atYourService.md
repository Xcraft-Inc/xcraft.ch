For building the application you dreamed, you will ask yourself some right
questions:

- my app will run for a single user in his device ?
- my app will run for a myriad of users, on a server ?

In all case, the crucial point is, my app is in all case a server hosting some
"little know" services, aka goblins!

Don't worry, if you choose xcraft and goblins for your next app, you can fit a
lot of deployment configuration and topology. You can deep dive into xcraft
topology chapters, for a better understanding.

So insteed of asking yourself hard questions, try with funny question:

- Entities ?
- CRUD ?
- Libraries ?
- Widgets ?
- Theming ?
- Translations ?
- Search ?

We already have theses goblins, and they can respond, at your service!

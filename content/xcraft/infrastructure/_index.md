### Chapter 3.1

# Infrastructure

A land needs roads, horses, dialects and more in order to trade between species

> Don't Be Afraid of the Dark

The infrastructure is organized by a network of Xcraft servers where it's
possible to have dedicated work for each node. A client in the network can be
just a front-end by command line or with a graphical interface. But a client can
be a server too. It's not something like usual µServices. In the nodes you can
find services, µServices, nanoServices, picoServices... A node can be on the
same host, or on an other. A node can be connected to multiple other nodes. It's
not magic, no need to have [Mana][1] for playing with Xcraft (or maybe a little
bit?).
